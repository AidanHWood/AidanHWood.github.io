      "details": "A bit of context here for everyone... \n\n ABAP or Advanced Business Application Programming, is SAPs primary high-level programming language.\n\n\n This CVE allowed attackers to run any ABAP commands they wanted inside the system, whether it was approved or not \n\n\n So why is this particularly interesting, well, resource planning software tends to contain highly sensitive information, such as corporate and financial data. \n\n So certain code injections, could potentailly lead to a full system compromise!! \n\n\n I conducted more research into the methodology behind the testing and found out that SAP systems \n typically communicate using RCFs or (Remote Function Calls).\n\n\n These calls are supposed to enforce authorisation checks on commands being requested \n\n but when researchers were testing low privilaged accounts, they realised that they could make calls that bypassed all authorization logic \n\n\n Allowing for inejection of ABAP code, directly into the ABAP runtime. \n\n\n Really dangerous stuff!!" ,
